# Machine-Learning-Cheat-Sheet

This cheat sheet was created so that if I forget something.
I can quickly turn to this repository and find the information I need. 
And also as part of ML training. Various algorithms and their implementations using different methods are presented here.

I will try to touch on all parts of machine learning in this repository.
there is a map on the resunka on which I will move.
And also marked in red are the methods that I have considered

In this repository, I will definitely not consider neural networks

# Binary classifications 
- classification by changing one parameter the angle of inclination.

# Binary Classifications on np 
- is an implementation of classification by loss function.

# Binary Classifications SGD 
- this is a neural network with an SGD optimizer

# Binary Classification on keras
In this file I experimented with optimizers, layers, activation functions and errors. And I plotted points and a line in international points where the network is not so sure of the classification.
If you take a lot of layers and layers, that is, obviously retrain, we will see this later.

In the photos I will show the result of the network, with each new graph the complexity of the network will increase.
