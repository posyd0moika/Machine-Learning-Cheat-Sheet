# Machine-Learning-Cheat-Sheet

This cheat sheet was created so that if I forget something.
I can quickly turn to this repository and find the information I need. 
And also as part of ML training. Various algorithms and their implementations using different methods are presented here.

I will try to touch on all parts of machine learning in this repository.
there is a map on the resunka on which I will move.
And also marked in red are the methods that I have considered

In this repository, I will definitely not consider neural networks
